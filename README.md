# Movies Image Board
Web app with an ASP.NET Core 5.0 MVC REST API and a razor pages client app, I used entityframework core as an ORM with an MSSQL server image for the database, and Identity core for authentication and authorization.
### Functionality
It's an app for users to have discussions about movies, users can create and delete posts after authenticating, they can filter posts by movie name and category, and also read and comment on other users posts.
### Running the app
You can run the app using docker-compose from the command line using docker-compose up or from visual studio, it will take time to pull images if you don't already have them and to build the application images.
