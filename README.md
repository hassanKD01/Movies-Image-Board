# Movies Image Board
ASP.NET Core 5.0 MVC REST API with a razor pages client app, I used entityframework core as an ORM with an MSSQL server image for the database, and Identity core for authentication and authorization.
### Functionality
It's an app for users to have discussions and to post their thoughts about movies, users can create posts after authenticating, they can filter posts by movie name and category, and comment on other users posts.
